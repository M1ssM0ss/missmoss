  <h1>My Favorite SCPs</h1>
  <h2>Work-in-progress!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1147">SCP-1147</a> is a plum tree with seeds that can grow in any substance. The resulting tree and its fruit display the properties of that substance. There are many instances of SCP-1147 from testing
      this property. Here are my favorites:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>SCP-1147-CO</b> - Its leaves can be soaked in water and quickly harden into <i>co</i>ncrete.</li>
      <li><b>SCP-1147-GL</b> - The tree is made of perfect <i>gl</i>ass, with leaves that refract light like prisms.</li>
      <li><b>SCP-1147-MO</b> - The tree is looks and smells like <i>mo</i>ney, but no pieces of it could pass as intact currency. I like this one for the witty remark by Dr. Laurel.</li>
      <li><b>SCP-1147-WA</b> - Planted in <i>wa</i>ter via hydroponics, the trunk resembles quartz and the fruits are like refreshing, slightly plummy water bottles.</li>
      <li><b>SCP-1147-ME</b> - It seems like it should be composed of cow <i>me</i>at. I was excited at the thought of a juicy steak coming from a tree, but tested D-Class described the taste of the cooked fruit as "gross" and "wrong". So much for my
        appetite.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-3349">SCP-3349</a>, also known as Printing EKG, is a heart condition that can manifest when someone is given certain amounts of certain medicines over a specific time frame. It makes their hearts
      occasionally emit static, purring, voices, and sometimes screaming.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5762">SCP-5762</a>, "a doctor a day", is an autonomous surgery robot that displays cute little messages on its text display. It shut itself down after a patient with traumatic injuries died on its operating
      table :(</li>
  </ul>
