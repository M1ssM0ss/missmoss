<p>Oh boy, this one's a doozy. A tape by LAIKA Home Video, in collaboration with Berksaut Forest Community School, containing children's stories about the Berksaut region. It's probably best to just transcribe them here. Note that it contains a
  few grammatical errors, but everything here is transcribed exactly as it is in the video.</p>
<p><span class="children"> In the past, the Berksaut region was in its majority uninhabited, with just a few farmers living in the region that in the future, would be Berksaut.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> The true founders of Berksaut.</span></p>
<p>The music is muffled for the next slide.</p>
<p><span class="children"> But unfortunately, they found something not suitable for such weak minds. Echoing through the cursed woods.</span></p>
<p>The background briefly fills with red before continuing with "The Adventures of little Jimmy!" [sic]</p>
<p><span class="children"> Little Jimmy was a happy boy in a happy family!</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> One day, little Jimmy got out to play in the forest even knowing that a thunderstorm was coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> He ran and ran through that woods, happy as never! How much time has already passed? Minutes, hours, days? He didn't care...</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> So little Jimmy looked up and saw those scary clouds coming after him and knew it was time to go home.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> But he got so distracted running through the forest and forgot which way was home.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> Little Jimmy remembered something that his dad said to him, to never get out of the house during a thunderstorm or something really bad is gonna happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> Jimmy saw an observation tower and concluded that he would be safe there.</span></p>
<p>The video briefly cuts to a black screen before returning.</p>
<p><span class="children"> As Jimmy walked in the direction of the observation tower, he heard some raindrops, and his anxiety got bigger and bigger.</span></p>
<p>There's another cut to black and a short-lived audio distortion. The happy music ends. The photograph provided with the next slide is a picture of a giant hole in the ground.</p>
<p><span class="children"> Jimmy encountered something, something that he will never forget</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> look closer little Jimmy, what do you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> look closer little Jimmy, what lies down there?</span></p>
<p>For a split second, the video's colors invert, and three glowing dots can be seen inside the hole, the same ones seen at the end of the Unusual Tour Guide video.</p>
<p><span class="children"> Little Jimmy made a friend.</span></p>
<p>Story 2, "The wacky television."</p>
<p><span class="children"> In the Berksaut Community School, the teacher of the younger students left the classroom and advised the students: "Do not touch the television during the storm!"</span></p>
<p>The next slide's image shows a picture of the same television from the experiments in the Radio video.</p>
<p><span class="children"> The very stubborn students decided to turn on the television</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> the static coming from the television invaded the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> After a while, two hands popped out of the screen</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> The students were scared and started screaming.</span></p>
<p>The colors invert for exactly two frames between each of the following slides. I checked this frame for hidden messages each time, but didn't find any.</p>
<p><span class="children"> The teacher ran into the room to turn the television off, but even after the teacher unplugged the television, it was still on.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> The secretary who was passing by heard the screams and decided to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> She screamed when she saw all the students and the teacher convulsing on the floor.</span></p>
<p>Story 3, "Our savior." This section has no music, just cricket noises.</p>
<p><span class="children"> On the night of August 25, 1921, something came to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="children"> The vibrant green, burning the eyes of whose dare to look at it. So beautiful. It is calling me.</span></p>
<p>The text other than "It is calling me." fades out before the next slide.</p>
<p><span class="children"> The thing came and in its womb, it carried the own devil's daughter.</span></p>
<p>Before the video fades out and ends, some glowing green lines appear in the image.</p>
<p>The video's description states that the three stories were confirmed to be true, and that Jimmy Williams disappeared on February 13th, 1974 (which was not a Friday, by the way, I checked).</p>
