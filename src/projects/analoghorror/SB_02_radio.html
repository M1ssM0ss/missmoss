<p>A production by WXVC Radio Station, that aims to teach the viewer about how radios work. The English in this video is poor, which may or may not be intentional.</p>
<p>The tape then states that it is top secret and only for authorized personell. The rest of the video is slightly tilted. It then states that, in 1943 (the date pixelated over but still readable), "a strange frequency was bouncing in the
  region of Berksaut, with anomalous properties." This frequency apparently creates images that paranoia, fear, and anxiety if stared at.</p>
<p>It then cuts to three recordings of an experiment that was conducted at an unknown time, because the year is pixelated to the point of being unreadable. The experiment seems to be testing the effects of these anomalous frequencies on a
  television. The clips take place inside a schoolroom because the wall is decorated with the sign language alphabet. In the first test, nothing happens. In the second test, the TV turns on and displays static. In the third test, the room is
  pitch black, and the screen shows text, which reads "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID", before a shadowy hand begins to cover it up. The "anomalies detected" note advises the reader to not run away from their sins.</p>
